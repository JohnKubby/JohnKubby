# John Kuboye - Data Scientist Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! I am a Data Scientist with a PhD in Mathematics and over 2 years of experience in applying machine learning, data analysis, and statistical techniques to solve real-world problems. My work focuses on delivering actionable insights and building predictive models that drive business value.

## About Me
I have extensive experience in machine learning, predictive modeling, and data analytics, specializing in healthcare and business intelligence. I am proficient in Python, SQL, MATLAB, and have worked with large datasets to develop innovative solutions that improve decision-making and efficiency.

## Projects

### 1. [Skin Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning](./skin-cancer-classification/README.md)
I developed a machine learning model to classify different types of skin cancer using ensemble techniques. This model achieved a high accuracy rate in distinguishing between various skin cancer types, showcasing my ability to handle healthcare-related data and apply machine learning algorithms effectively.

### 2. [Sales Forecasting Model](./sales-forecasting/README.md)
In this project, I built a time-series forecasting model using Python that resulted in a 20% increase in sales for a key client. The model accurately predicted sales trends and allowed for better inventory management and marketing strategies.

### 3. [Business Intelligence Dashboard](./business-intelligence-dashboard/README.md)
I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides executives with real-time insights into key business metrics. This dashboard helped streamline decision-making processes, reducing the time to generate reports by 40%.
